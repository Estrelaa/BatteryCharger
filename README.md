# BatteryCharger
A ESO addon that automatically recharges your weapons when it is depleted. 

# Running the Addon
As this is an ESO addon, it can only be run in ESO. When you want to run it simply drop the "BatteryCharger" folder in the root of the repo into your addons folder in ESO. On windows this is ".../Documents/Elder Scrolls Online/live/Addons"

# Developing
To edit the code, clone it using git then open up the lua file in your favorite lua IDE or text editor. I personally use Visual studio code with [a Lua extension by Sumneko](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sumneko.lua) for code completion. Use the [ESOUI wiki](https://wiki.esoui.com/Main_Page) to find 95% of events and functions that can be used in addons.

# BatteryCharger
A ESO addon that automatically recharges your weapons when it is depleted, using soulgems in your inventory, because it bloody annoying to remember doing it.

# installing
Simply download, then drop the "BatteryCharger" folder in the root of the repo into your addons folder in ESO. On windows this is ".../Documents/Elder Scrolls Online/live/Addons". No other libaries are needed, as the addon is completely standalone.
